				<div class="myth">
					<p>Dionysus (also spelled Dionysos or called Bacchus) is a nature god of fruitfulness and vegetation and is especially known as a god of wine and ecstasy. Dionysus had the power to inspire and to create ecstasy, and his cult had special importance for art and literature.  Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and thus symbolizes everything which is chaotic, dangerous and unexpected, everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods.
