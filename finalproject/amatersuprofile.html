				<div class="myth">
					<p>Amaterasu is a sun goddess and one of the most prominent deities of the Shinto religion. The first mention of her is found in a text from 680 CE. She and her two brothers, Susanoo and Tsukuyomi, created Japan with their paintbrushes. Amaterasu has a strained relationship with her brothers: Tsukuyomi, the moon, distressed her by killing another goddess, so Amaterasu separated night and day so she would not have to share the sky with him. Susanoo, the god of the sea and storms, treated her rudely and so she hid from him in a cave and deprived the world of light. She was only lured out again by the sight of her own reflection and the crowing of a rooster. A mirror is kept at her shrine in Ise, said to be the actual mirror that brought her out of her cave. The Japanese imperial family claims to be descended from Amaterasu. In the comic, Amaterasu is the most benevolent, kind, and patient of the gods introduced so far. She responds calmly to criticism from an interviewer and inspires a kind of widespread euphoria during her stage performance.
